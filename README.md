# Native Jaky je boha tyzden ðŸ“…  

For when TUKE students face the *ultimate academic mystery*: "What week is it?" ðŸ¤”  

Introducing native **Jaky je boha tyzden**, the project solving this colossal dilemma with the *engineering excellence we all secretly wanted*. Because why wouldnâ€™t you need:  
- A full-fledged **iPhone app** ðŸ“±  
- An **Apple Watch app** âŒš (because your wrist deserves answers too)  
- iOS and watchOS **widgets** ðŸ“Š (for the ultimate procrastination convenience)  

Inspired by the [original **Jaky je boha tyzden**](https://github.com/lubomirdruga/jaky-je-boha-tyzden), this version takes things to the next level.  

While it might seem like a bit much for such a small problem, I prefer to think of it as *delivering excellence*. After all, this is the way. ðŸ˜‰
